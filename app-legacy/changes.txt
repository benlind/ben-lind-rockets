The main thing that I did between part one and two of this project was I added
javascript functionality to the site. This included animations on the SVG
illustration, section dividers, and buttons. I also added a "Projects" section
to the site that contains images of some of the websites I have created.

If there was a third part of my project, I would use it to set up stagina and
production stages so that I could test my changes before making them live on my
website. I would also complete the items listed under "TODO" in the repo
readme.

In part two, I learned how to animate SVG elements with CSS, as well as how to
replace the SVG with an image for people whose browser does not support SVG.

I enjoyed this project because it gave me an "excuse" to rebuild my personal
website. I have wanted to redesign my website for a while, but I did not have
enough time to do so until this class. To make the project better, perhaps there
could have been a requirement for more PHP. I already knew PHP coming into the
class, but for those students who did not know it, it might have been helpful to
have to write more PHP code. Besides this, I think the project requirements were
good.
