# Ben Lind's Personal Site
This is the repository for the personal site of Ben Lind. It is currently in the alpha stage of development, but I plan on eventually using it to replace my current website at [benlind.com](benlind.com).

# Project Plan
## Technology
The back end of this website will be written in PHP. This PHP will be closely coupled with the HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front end, but I hope to maintain a level of separation between the back and front ends of the site. I do not plan on using a full-fledged MVC layout because the scope of this site is small, and I do not have much database data to work with.

## Purpose and Features
I am a web developer, currently on a freelance level but soon on a professional level as well. This website will primarily be a place where I can showcase some of my web development work.

Here are some of the specific features that I expect to be on the site:

- A list of websites that I have created, along with descriptions and screenshots
- A contact form where people can request service
- A resume/cv

Other possible features:

- Blog
- Photography gallery

In the end, I want to try to create something unique and creative that will reflect my skills as a web developer. I have seen plenty of bland single-page portfolios, and I don't want to fall into the same trap of forgettability.

## Front End Framework
I am currently debating whether to use Bootstrap or Foundation as the site's front end framework. I have experience with Bootstrap, so it would be easy to get up and running with that. However, studying Computer Science in school means that I am always open to learning new technologies, so I will likely give Foundation a try for this project. Who knows? I might like it better than Bootstrap!

## Very Ambitious Goals
Ultimately, I hope that this project ["doesn't do anything new"](https://xkcd.com/1497/) and I hope that eventually I can [reach shallow water](https://xkcd.com/349/) in time.
